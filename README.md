This application was design to help people who collect loungefly be able to understand the different catogorys of backpakcs and crossbodys. This also helps new collectors to understand how many backpacks and crossbodys that their is so that they can understand where they would like to start their collection.

The application is currently able to create an account, read a loungefly database and to also add a new loungefly to the database and also delete a loungefly from the dtatabase.
